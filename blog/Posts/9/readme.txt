This directory includes blog_post.json and a blog_post.md that both need to be edited in order to write a blog-post. Date & time, the title and summary can be set in the JSON file. The markdown-file resembles the blog-posts main-text. 

Images can be added to the media-directory which must be referenced in the text-section in blog_post.json. Please note that if you change the date in the JSON-file to not alter the format of the date. It always needs to be "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss". If you want to change how the date is displayed alter it in the template file directly instead.

Further help and instructions can be found in blog_post.json.

Once the blog-postis written the blog can be generated for uploading to a webserver. Running Schmitzkatz.jar without any arguments explains how this can be achieved.
