						Growing up next to a lake I have always been fascinated by the underwater world. A recent article in the Daily Mail about a man creating his own ecosphere in a sealed bottle got me interested in building my own.

						<p>A recent <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267504/The-sealed-bottle-garden-thriving-40-years-fresh-air-water.html">article</a> in the Daily Mail showed a man who had created his own ecosphere by putting soil and some waterplants into a bottle, filling it with water and sealing it. He hasn't had to put any new water into it for 40 years and inside the bottle is a fully functioning ecosystem.</p>

<p>This got me so excited that I started researching on various sites. There are companies that offer small finished ecospheres with little freshwater shrimp inside. To be honest I don't like the idea of keeping animals in small glasses.</p>

<p>After some more research and time I decided to just go for it and bought a bottle (15 liters) and aquarium soil (2 kilograms). My experience from aquariums and also reading various articles on the web I decided to get a fast growing plant called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabomba_caroliniana">Cabomba caroliniana</a>. Another candidate is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elodea">Elodea</a> which isn't very picky when it comes to water quality.</p>

<p><img src="media/material.jpg" alt="Things you need to get started" /></p>

<p>You should not get too many plants as they should grow into the ecosystem themselves. I only got one bunch of Cabomba caroliniana and will watch it grow over the next few weeks. Hopefully I can report back positively next time I write about this.</p>

<p>Putting the soil into the bottle and getting the plants into the ground through the hole in the bottle turned out to be quite tricky. I used a long stick to push the plants into the ground. </p>

<p><img src="media/planted.jpg" alt="Plants added to the aquarium. I removed some plants later on, because I had too many" /></p>

<p>After planting I was set to add water. I just unscrewed the shower head and slowly added water to not wash the plants out of the soil. After 2 minutes the bottle was filled with water. I didn't seal it just yet. In a few weeks I will add some freshwater shrimp and seal it. You will be able to read about it here!</p>

<p>If you are wondering about the prices, all of this cost me around 50 euros. You can get these kinds of glassbottles on Ebay, for example.</p>
